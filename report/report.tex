\section{Introduction}
This project aims to detect the numbers within a given Sudoku puzzle using strictly image processing techniques and produce a 2D output array to be consumed by a Sudoku puzzle solver. The output should be written to a text file which can be consumed by the Sudoku solver library.

\section{Problem Domain}
The problem domain for this project is to apply image processing techniques on given Sudoku puzzle image. The image processing techniques used span the following domains: image thresholding, connected component analysis, boundary detection and the filtering of images using mathematical morphological operations.
